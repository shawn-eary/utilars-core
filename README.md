# utilars-core

This is the source for my personal website https://www.utilars.com . I suppose it would be asking much for me to plead that malicious users not hack me or that Google and/or Bing refrain from censoring my political views via their search engine algorithms.

There are a ton of bugs in this site right now. It's being migrated from .NET 4.5 to .NET 6. The appsettings and dfpt.config.json files have been excluded for security reasons.

There isn't a lot of code in here. Mainly because in the beginning, I just used static files.

I'm getting sick and tired of the censorship here in America and the claim that COVID is a real threat. If you are worried about COVID, talk to your doctor about doing as much of the following as you reasonably can: 
1. get some exercise
2. get 8+ hours of sleep a night
3. get 15+ minutes of sun around noon every day to your bare skin (guys, take your shirt off and go in shorts)
4. eat 1-2 cans of Salmon per week
5. eat 1 or 2 Brazil Nuts each day
6. eat 3 chicken eggs per day
7. leave those of us that don't want a COVID jab alone... 

Stop threatening people that don't want to support abortion and/or the COVID vaccines.

My current understanding is that as of December 29, 2021, every single U.S. Approved COVID vaccine to include J&J uses either mRNA or DNA technology and was researched using aborted fetal cells. I rarely take medications and while I have willingly taken vaccines in the past, I was not told they were developed using aborted fetal cells. I find it unethical to knowingly take medications that were developed using aborted fetal cells. J&J will try to tell you that it is a "viral vector" vaccine but I think that is just marketing hype that is used as a smokescreen to conceal the fact that the J&J COVID vaccine is DNA based.

Maybe the Novavax protein subunit COVID candidate will be safer and more ethical, but even if it is, I don't want to take three Novavax shots every year. I **might** be willing to take one Novavax shot per year.

I will continue to try to not spread my germs on other people, but I refuse these potentially dangerous vaccines. They way I see it is that we should all repent of our sins and:
"Do to others as you would have them do to you." - Jesus - Luke 6:31 NIV
