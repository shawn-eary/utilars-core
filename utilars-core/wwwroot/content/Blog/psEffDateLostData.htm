      <p>
         Once again, I was working on a PeopleSoft project.  
         While working on a page that had three "related" tables, I 
         made an interesting error that temporarily caused to me 
         misplace some data.
      </p>
      <p>
         The three tables were all related by two keys.  One of the keys
         was a string proprietary to my employer and the other key was 
         Effective Date (EffDt).  I needed to get rid of some old and 
         unused columns in the main table of the three.
      </p>
      <p>
         I eliminated the columns with ease and saved the table, but then 
         I had to <b>build</b> the table according to current PeopleSoft 
         practice.  Of course when I built the table, I got an error explaining
         that my current settings wouldn't allow PeopleSoft to drop tables that had data in them.  Then, I tried
         alter by table rename with the drop columns option, but that <b>also</b> gave 
         me an error.  Eventually, I decided to <b>nuke</b> the table by recreating it.
         This of course blew away all of my data in the table, but I 
         <b>expected</b> that.
      </p>
      <p>
         Since there wasn't much data to recover, I decided to use a combination
         of copy/paste and manual typing to put the data back in the <b>main</b>
         table. When I got the data back in, I was pleased to find that the level 0 
         data on my page was mostly correct.  Then, I was not
         so happy when I noticed that my level 1 data was <b>gasp</b> "missing."
      </p>
      <p>
         I knew I had not messed with any of the data in the other two tables, 
         so I couldn't understand where my level 1 data went.  After all, I  
         hadn't even touched my level 1 tables.  Just to make sure, I looked 
         in my version of Oracle SQL Developer and found that the data was 
         still there.
      </p>
      <p>
         I couldn't figure out what gave, so I played around with the keys 
         of the <b>main</b> table for a while.  Unfortunately, that didn't 
         work.  Apparently, I had not done anything serious to damage the 
         keys that relate all three of the tables. 
      </p>
      <p>
         Eventually, it dawned on me that there must be a non-visible 
         error in the data for the table keys.  Even though the key data <b>looked</b> okay
         to me, I thought I must have missed some: special characters; extra spaces; or, 
         invisible characters.  After checking the keys for a while, I realized
         the problem had to be the EffDt field.
      </p>
      <p>
         I ran an SQL statement similar to the following and the cause of the 
         error was apparent:
         <pre>
         <code class="language-SQL">
         select * from tableOfInterest where EffDt = '3-SEP-2015';
         </code>
         </pre>         
         <span class="sideNote">
         (Table name and date were actually different in my environment)
         </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         When I got around to running the above mentioned SQL statement, I 
         believe I had only one row with a date of 3-SEP-2015 actually show up 
         with several others that didn't.  That clued me in on the fact that 
         Oracle SQL Developer was probably not showing me the entire dateTime
         value for my EffDt column.  Some of the rows apparently had different 
         <b>times of days</b> for the EffDt column even though they all 
         had the same <b>date</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
         When I realized the problem, I simply ran a few SQL update statements
         to correct the unmatched EffDt values.  In my case, I didn't have 
         much data and I was in a test environment, so I could simply do 
         something similar to this:
         <pre>
         <code class="language-SQL">
            update tableOfInterest set EffDt = '3-SEP-2015';
            update relatedTable1 set EffDt = '3-SEP-2015';
            update relatedTable2 set EffDt = '3-SEP-2015';
         </code>
         </pre>
      </p>
      <p>
         Once the EffDt values were all matching, my Level 1 data 
         reappareed on the page I was working with, and I no longer 
         had to be in panic mode.  Fortunately, I didn't break 
         anything afterall...
