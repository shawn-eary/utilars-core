        For fun, I am taking Music Theory One (MUTH1603) at University
        or Arkansas in my free time. Unfortunately, I'm getting slammed.
        The other students in the class are much faster and more accurate
        than me. My professor gave us some tricks to follow for triad
        creation, but I still struggle to get things done correctly at
        the required speed.
        </p>
        <p>
        Theoretically, my brain should be smart enough to quickly recreate
        major, minor, diminished and augmented triads using the techniques mentioned in the Fundamentals unit of
        Open Music Theory <a href="#src2">[2]</a> or other similar texts.
        In reality, I'm too slow 🐢.
        </p>
        <p>
        Because I'm so slow, I figure now would be a good time for me to
        start memorizing all root position major triads (including
        enharmonic spellings). I started with the well known A C E minor
        triad and changed it to major by adding a half step to the
        third. That got me A C♯ E. I then just went down the list:
        </p>
        <p>
        <table class="generic-blog-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                <th>Triad</th><th>Root</th><th>3rd</th><th>5th</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
<tr><td>A♭ Major</td><td>A♭</td><td>C</td><td>E♭</td></tr>
<tr><td>A Major</td><td>A</td><td>C♯</td><td>E</td></tr>

        <p>
        This list of triads is common knowledge and you are bound to
        find it other places. In fact, I think I saw the list on
        Wikipedia at one time, but I'm not finding it when I search right
        now.
        </p>
        <p>
        So what is the point of this? Well, it took me a little time to
        come up with that Major triad list. I would argue that <b>struggling</b>
        Freshman music majors should not only memorize all Major, Natural Minor, 
        Melodic Minor and Harmonic Minor key signatures, but that they
        should also memorize <b>all</b> of the Major triad spellings shown above.
        </p>
        <p>
        Even though exceptionally bright entering music students
        will be able to do all of the calculations in their head, that is
        <b>not</b> the case for me. For this reason, my plan is to memorize all of the
        above Major spellings and then use the tricks my professor taught
        me to convert the Major spellings into the needed augmented,
        diminished and minor triads as needed. For me, this will probably
        be a little faster and more accurate than other methods of triad
        construction that I've been using.
        </p>
        <p>
        I Hope this thought helps me and someone else. Even if you are
        only in High School, you might want to memorize those spellings above presuming you can't already calculate them in your
        head with the speed and accuracy of an
        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABET">ABET</a> certified engineer 😊.
