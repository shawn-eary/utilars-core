        <p>
            I've been goofing around on my bicycle too much to take interest in
            blogging, but I recently ran across an interesting PeopleSoft error with
            a simple solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            I got an SQR from Oracle that was apparently meant to be run only from
            SQR Express (or similar tool) in interactive mode.  Unfortunately, my
            institution wanted to run it in the Web Based PeopleSoft Pure Internet
            Architecture (PIA).  I was unfamiliar with SQR but I made the minimal
            changes necessary so I could launch the SQR from a Run Control within the
            PIA.  Then I ran it and got a weird error...
        </p>
        <p>
            I kept getting the error "Process Request shows status of 'INITIATED' or 'PROCESSING' but no longer running."
            in my Message Log and the Process Monitor status always showed a status of Error.  The
            funny thing is that the SQR from Oracle seemed to be working just fine.
            I searched around the internet and thumbed though a book I had on hand [1] for a solution but didn't
            find exactly what I was looking for.  Eventually, I started looking through
            the working SQRs my institution had and noticed StdAPI-Term wasn't being
            called at the end of the SQR.  I put that line in at the end of my SQR
            and Viola!  The error went away.
        </p>
        <p>
            Granted it wasn't exactly that simple.  There are a *few* things you also
            have to do *in addition* to calling StdAPI-Term like maybe including
            setenv.sqc and calling stdapi-init [1], but I had already done that
            previously and the final thing that got rid of the error was the
            StdAPI-Term call.  So if you are getting the error mentioned in the
            title of this article, check and make sure your SQR matches the simple form
            mentioned in [2] and make sure you have a "Do stdapi-term" statement at the
            end of your SQR.
