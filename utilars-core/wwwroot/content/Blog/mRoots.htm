   The last few months, I have been blogging about F#.   While I am a 
   big fan of F#, I would like to part from that discussion to talk 
   about yet another topic that interests me.  I have been trying for 
   a while to understand the Fourier Transform; unfortunately, I often 
   feel like a deer staring into headlights when I look at the 
   standard Fourier Transform summation formula.  I suppose the only 
   way for me to really get this is to take it a step at a time and 
   start with something *relatively* basic such as M-Roots.  
   </p>

   <p>
   When you were young, your teacher probably told you that the square 
   root of a number M was some number N that when multiplied by itself
   equaled M.   Your teacher may not have used those words, but may 
   have said something like “The square root of sixteen is four 
   because four times four equals sixteen and the square root of nine
   is three because three times three equals nine." 
   </p>

   <p>
   Hopefully, your teacher drove home the fact that this wasn’t the 
   whole story.  You probably know that in addition to the above, 
   -3 * -3 = 9 and -4 * -4 = 16.   So 9 doesn’t just have the square 
   root of 3.  It also has a square root of -3 and 16 doesn’t just 
   have a square root of 4, it also has the square root of -4.  In 
   fact, for any Complex Number, there are exactly two square roots 
   <a href="#src1">[1]</a>.
   </p>

   <p>
   Okay, so what is a Complex Number?   You probably already know 
   this also, but a Complex Number contains a both a real and 
   Imaginary Number.  So what is an Imaginary Number?  An Imaginary 
   Number is basically what you get when 
   you try to take the square root of a negative number.   The 
   square root of 100 is obviously 10 since 10 * 10 = 100, but 
   what is the square root of -100?  Uuuh,  I-Dough-Know…   
   </p>

   <p>
   If you are new to Complex Numbers, you might try to guess that 
   the square root of -100 is -10, but that doesn’t work since 
   -10 * -10 = 100.   So what is the square root of -100?  Well, to 
   solve that problem you might want to break it down.  -100 can be 
   expressed as -1 * 100 or better yet 100 * -1.   Now, we can take 
   the square root of (100 * -1)  which is the same as 
   <math>
      <mrow>
         <msqrt><mn>100</mn></msqrt>
         <mo>*</mo>
         <msqrt><mn>-1</mn></msqrt>
      </mrow>
   </math>
   </p>

   <p>
   So what is <math><msqrt><mn>-1</mn></msqrt></math>?  To be honest,
   I have no clue.  I just know that most folks call that <i>i</i>.
   What's <i>i</i>?  Well that's the <math><msqrt><mn>-1</mn></msqrt></math>
   of course!  Don't you know that :-) ?   If you don't believe me 
   you can solve the equation in <a href="#src2">[2]</a> on your own 
   time...
   </p>

   <p>
   So then, from the above we have that the square root of -100 is 
   <math>
      <mrow>       
         <msqrt><mn>-1</mn></msqrt>
         <mo>*</mo>         
         <msqrt><mn>100</mn></msqrt>
      </mrow>
   </math>
   or 
   <math>
      <mrow>       
         <msqrt><mn>100</mn></msqrt>         
         <mo>*</mo>         
         <msqrt><mn>-1</mn></msqrt>
      </mrow>
   </math>
   which is 
   <math>
      <mrow>       
         <mi>10</mi>
         <mo>*</mo>         
         <msqrt><mn>-1</mn></msqrt>
      </mrow>
   </math>
   which is simply: 10i.
   </p>

   <p>
   So in this case, the Imaginary Number 10i can be represented as the 
   Complex Number 0+10i because there is no real component and there
   are 10 units of the imaginary component <a href="#src3">[3]</a>.  
   </p>

   <p>
   So what is the point in mentioning Complex Numbers?  Well, it has
   to do with how many roots we can get for a number.  Remember when 
   I said that for any Complex Number there are exactly two square 
   roots <a href="#src1">[1]</a>?  As it turns out, we can generalize 
   that statement and say that for any Complex Number there are exactly 
   M number of M<sup>th</sup> roots.  In <a href="#src4">[4]</a>, Dr. Smith says 
   “...the M<sup>th</sup> root of a, which is written as a<sup>1/M</sup>, is not 
   unique--there are M of them.”  So with the help of Dr. Smith 
   (and others), we know that there are exactly two square roots for 
   any number, three cube roots, four fourth roots and so on.  In 
   order to find all of these roots, we usually need Complex Numbers. 
   </p>

   <p>
   So it’s pretty obvious how to get the square root of a number.  
   In most cases, an intelligent person can just guess and get a 
   correct answer, but it gets harder when you have to calculate the 
   cube roots or maybe even the 4<sup>th</sup> roots or the 
   128<sup>th</sup> roots. 
   Fortunately, Dr. Smith presents a formula in his text that we can 
   use.  So let's see if we can figure out how Dr. Smith derives that
   presented formula...
   </p>

   <p>
   At the beginning of his discussion, Dr. Smith says that any 
   Complex Number can be expressed as follows:
   <math>   
   <mrow>
   <mi>z</mi>
   <mo>=</mo>
   <msup>
   <mrow>
   <mi>r</mi>
   <mi>e</mi>
   </mrow>
   <mi>
   j&theta; 
   </mi>
   </msup>      
   </mrow>
   </math>.<br />
   <span class="sideNote">
   [Dr. Smith uses j to represent the square root of -1 instead of i.  
   This is fairly common practice.  Both j and i generally mean the 
   same thing; however, I personally prefer to use the letter i and 
   will try to use i whenever possible from here out.]</span>
   <br /><br />
   When Dr. Smith says this, he basically means that any Complex
   Number can be translated into polar cordinates where r is a 
   magnitude and i&theta; is a phase.  If you want an example of how 
   this is so, you can follow <a href="#src5">[5]</a> to see that a 
   Complex Number x + y<i>i</i> = r(cos &theta; + <i>i</i> sin &theta;).  You can 
   then use Euler's Identity *mentioned* by Mr. Roelandts in <a href="#src6">[6]</a> to substitute 
   e<sup><i>i</i>&theta;</sup> for (cos &theta; + <i>i</i> sin &theta;) and get the 
   final answer that z = x + y<i>i</i> = r*e<sup><i>i</i>&theta;</sup>
   just like Dr. Smith said.<br />
   <span class="sideNote">
   [In case you don't have time to read *all* of Mr. Roelandts' article,
   you can look to the derivation section where you will find the 
   useful formula<br />
   e<sup><i>i&theta;</i></sup>=cos &theta; + <i>i</i> sin &theta;<br />
   but please note that Mr. Roelandts uses x in his formula instead of 
   &theta;]
   </span>
   </p>

   <p>
   Now, with the formula 
      <math>   
   <mrow>
   <mi>z</mi>
   <mo>=</mo>
   <msup>
   <mrow>
   <mi>r</mi>
   <mi>e</mi>
   </mrow>
   <mi>
   i&theta; 
   </mi>
   </msup>      
   </mrow>
   </math>, goofy me thinks I can just take the root of both sides of the 
   equation to get the M roots, but that doesn't work because the 
   result will not have "k" which is an iteration constant you will 
   need to find all *M* of the M-Roots.  Instead, Dr. Smith uses 
   Euler's Identity again to introduce "k" with a trick.  Dr. Smith 
   says that since 
   e<sup>i&theta;</sup>=cos &theta; + <i>i</i> sin &theta; that
   e<sup><i>i</i>2&pi;<i>k</i></sup>=cos(2&pi;k) + <i>i</i> sin(2&pi;k).
   Now, if you think for a minute, you will see that the new adjusted
   equation always equals 1.  No joke!!!  I'm not about to prove it, 
   but try evaluating cos(2&pi;k) + <i>i</i> sin(2&pi;k) for numerous 
   integer values of k. You *should* get 1 every time.
   </p>

   <p>
   So since e<sup><i>i</i>2&pi;<i>k</i></sup> always equals one, there isn't any harm
   in multiplying it by any side or *both* sides of an equation.  Dr. 
   Smith takes this step and comes up with: 
   z = <i>r</i><i>e</i><sup><i>i</i>&theta;</sup><i>e</i><sup><i>i</i>2&pi;<i>k</i></sup>.
   </p>

   <p>
   I you are intersted, you can then go to Dr. Smith's book 
   <a href="#src4">[4]</a> to see finally how he takes the m<sup>th</sup>
   root of both sides to come up with the final equation. 
   </p>

   </math>

   <p>
   Now, if you are like me. You *may* be starring at the equation 
   Dr. Smith presented wondering what in the world he just said.  
   In particular, I'm a bit rusty with Euler's Identity and polar 
   coordinates.  What don't we 
   *try* and use Euler's Identity to get rid of that ugly <i>e</i>
   constant.  If you want to learn more about <i>e</i> you are welcome 
   to go to <a href="#src7">[7]</a>, but personally, I would just 
   prefer to send <i>e</i> on its way right now...
   </p>

   <p>
   So in my usual style, I’m going to make a Huge Ugly Guess (HUG) and 
   hope that I am mathematically allowed to assign 
   <math>
   <mfrac>
   <mrow><mi>&theta;</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mi>&pi;k</mi></mrow>
   <mi>M</mi>
   </mfrac>
   </math>
   to the variable x.  Then, I'm going to use Euler's Identity as 
   mentioned by Mr. Roelandts in <a href="#src6">[6]</a> to try and 
   come up with a simplified version of the equation Dr. Smith 
   demonstrated.  So anyway, if I apply Euler's Identity to the equation 
   Dr. Smith showed previously, then I *think* I get something like 
   this:<br />

      <math>

   Walla!!! <i>e</i> is gone.  Now, M is the root "level" I am taking
   which is 2 for square root, 3 for cube root and so on; therefore, 
   the value "M" is known.  I know what 2&pi; is - that's just some constant.  Also,
   k is all numbers between 0 and M-1.  So I guess, I need to figure
   out what <i>r</i> and &theta; are.  Well, I *think* <i>r</i> is just
   the magnitude of the Complex Number and &theta; is just the phase, 
   so I should be good to go.  I *think* I have everything I need to 
   solve the equation now.  So to drive this home, I think I should
   try an example.  People such as me like examples...
   </p>

   <p>
   Let's try to find the four fourth roots of the number 16+0i (which 
   is also simply known as the real number 16).  Before we even start, 
   we can already find two on them in our head.  Two of the 
   4<sup>th</sup> roots are 2 and -2 since 2*2*2*2 = 16 and 
   -2*-2*-2*-2=16.  But Dr. Smith told us earlier that there should be
   four fourth roots of any Complex Number.  Since 16 is a special 
   case of the Complex Number 16+0i, we are missing two roots.  How 
   would we find them?  With the equation that Dr. Smith demonstrated
   of course!!!
   </p>
   <p>
   In that equation, we know that M is 4 and k is all integers from 
   0 to 3 inclusive.  So we just need to find &theta; and <i>r</i> and 
   we will be set.  In our particular case, we are lucky and &theta; 
   is 0 because we are dealing with a real number 16.  You can look 
   back at Bourne's article <a href="#src5">[5]</a> to verify this.  
   Also, because 16 is a real number we are in luck again and the 
   magnitude of <i>r</i> is simply 16.  Again, you can review 
   <a href="#src5">[5]</a> to see how to compute the magnitude of a 
   Complex Number.  Lastly, we know that <i>i</i> is just the square root of
   -1.  So we finally have everything we need, so we just go a 
   pluggin...

   For k=0 we obviously get 2 since the sine term automatically 
   cancels out and the cos term evaluates to one.  This leaves us 
   with nothing more than the 4<sup>th</sup> root of the real number 16 which 
   was obviously 2.  
   </p>
   <p>
   For k=2 we have a similar situation since the sin term cancels out
   and the cos term evaluates to -1.  So when the magnitude <i>r</i> is
   raised the the 
   <math>
   <mfrac>
   <mn>1</mn><mn>4</mn>
   </mfrac>
   </math>
   &nbsp;power, we get 2 which is then multipled by -1 to get the 
   final *real* result of -2. 
   </p>

   <p>
   Now, if we simplify the k=1 case above we get:<br />

   </mrow>   
   </math><br />
   <br />
   or finally:<br />
   0 + 2<i>i</i>
   </p>

   <p>
   I leave it as an exercise for the reader to show that the k=3 case
   yields 0 - 2<i>i</i>, but you should intiutively know that this 
   happens because the sin(2&pi;3/4) imaginary term will evaluate 
   to -1 and the cos(2&pi;3/4) real term will evaluate to zero. 
   </p>

   <p>
   So we finally have determined the four 4<sup>th</sup> roots of 
   16 which is also known as 16+0<i>i</i>.  Those roots are as follows:
   2+0i, -2+0i, 0+2i, and 0-2i.  A plot of these roots appears 
   below in Figure#1:

    The interesting part of these M<sup>th</sup> roots is that they 
    will always be evenly spaced around a circle with radius equal to 
    the value of the magnitude of the Complex Number raised to the 
    power of 1/M.  You can see that by watching the 
    <a href="#src8">[8]</a> demo at MathWorld.  The M<sup>th</sup>
    roots of unity are simply a special case of the M<sup>th</sup>
    roots that are covered here, so the Rowland and Weisstein article
    would be a great suplimentary article if you don't quite get 
    what I am saying here or you don't quite follow Dr. Smith's 
    approach <a href="#src4">[4]</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    With all of this said, we have given a basic overview of the 
    concent of M<sup>th</sup> roots.  In fact, you are welcome to 
    take the 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup> roots of 16+0<i>i</i> 
    on your own time.  Or you might even try taking taking roots of 
    Complex Numbers.  It's up to you, but one thing remains.  We should
    show that when each of the 4<sup>th</sup> roots we determined is 
    multiplied by itself four times, we get 16+0<i>i</i> or simply 16.
    I'm not sure I have the time to do all four of the examples but I 
    will try the easiest ones. 
    </p>

    <p>
    We said the fourth roots of 16 was 2+0i, -2+0i, 0+2i, and 0-2i.
    Well, we can easly see that 2*2*2*2=16 and that -2*-2*-2*-2=16, so
    lets see what happens when we multiply (0-2i) by itself four times.
    For starters we get:<br />
    (0-2i)*(0-2i)*(0-2i)*(0-2i)<br />
    this becomes<br />
    (-2i)*(-2i)*(-2i)*(-2i)<br />
    which is<br />
    (4i<sup>2</sup>)*(-2i)*(-2i)<br />
    Now, because the square of i is -1, we have<br />
    (4*(-1))*(-2i)*(-2i)<br />
    which is<br />
    -4*(-2i)*(-2i)<br />
    which is<br />
    -4*(4i<sup>2</sup>)<br />
    which is<br />
    -4*(4*(-1))<br />
    which is<br />
    -4*-4 which is obviously 16.
    </p>

    <p>
    I leave it as an exercise to the reader to prove that 
    (0+2i)<sup>4</sup> = 16.  Now, I will mention the caveat.  I 
    had it easy.  I was lucky because all of my 4<sup>th</sup> roots
    were purely real or purely imaginary.  That made the multiplication
    of my roots by themselves quite easy.  In many cases, you will 
    have a complex m<sup>th</sup> root that has both real *and* 
    imaginary components.  In that case, if you want to multiply the 
    root by itself you will have to use the FOIL method.  Most likely,
    you are already familiar with FOIL, but there is a good example of 
    it at <a href="#src9">[9]</a> if you need help. 
    </p>

    <p>
    That's about all I'm going to say on M<sup>th</sup> roots.  So 
    why would someone want to know this?  Well, if you want to evenly
    space a bunch of points around a circle, it might be useful.  It 
    seems to me that such a technique *might* be useful in drawing 
    3D cylindrical based meshes, but I hope to get into that at some
    future date.  The main reason I think someone would want to know
    about M<sup>th</sup> roots is that it makes it easier to 
    understand what's going on in the Fourier Transform.  I don't know
    the exact details at this moment, but I *think* I read somewhere
    that if you have the M<sup>th</sup> roots of unity 
    <a href="#src10">[10]</a>, then it 
    becomes easier to evaluate the Fourier Transform.  Hopefully, I 
    will be able to get to that in the next few months without frying 
    my brain...
