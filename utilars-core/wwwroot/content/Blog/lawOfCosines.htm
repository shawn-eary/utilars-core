      <p>
      When I was in secondary school, I was taught the ever 
      familiar c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> for 
      the right triangle.  This is the well known 
      Pythagorean Theorem <a href="#src1">[1]</a>
      </p>
      <p>
      The Pythagorean Theorem is a super easy way to compute 
      lengths of many objects because at lot of objects can be simplified
      into right triangles; unfortunately, the Pythagorean Theorem 
      only works for <b>right</b> triangles.  To demonstrate the 
      Pythagorean Theorem, I use an example. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Suppose for a minute that you managed a large nature center called Blue Mountain Arboretum 
      as seen in Figure#1 below:
      </p>

         <figcaption>
            Figure 1
         </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
      Further suppose that your patrons lost interest in the 
      Visitor and Education Center shown in Figure#1 and 
      instead became more 
      interested in the new Parque de Flores exhibit.  After
      receiving several complaints from patrons about how long and boring 
      the walk around the Visitor Center was, 
      you consider commissioning some engineers to build a path 
      through the Visitor Center from the intersection of 
      Hola Camino and Cherry Lane to the intersection of 
      Swan Street and Pear Street.  
      </p>
      <p>
      Presently, your patrons have to travel approximately 2500 ft + 
      800 ft for a total of 3300 ft to get from the park entrance to
      the intersection of Swan Street and Pear Street, but you are 
      wondering if allowing them to cut diagonally through the center
      would save them much walking distance so you decide to use the 
      Pythagorean Theorem.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Pythagorean Theorem works for you because Swan Street 
      and Cherry Lane form a right angle and the path we want 
      across the visitor center is a hypotenuse opposite that 
      said right angle.  Now, if you use the Pythagorean Theorem 
      and do the math, your work might look something like this: 
      </p>
      <p>
      c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup><br />
      c<sup>2</sup> = 2500<sup>2</sup> + 800<sup>2</sup><br />
      c<sup>2</sup> = 6250000 + 640000<br />
      c<sup>2</sup> = 6890000<br />
      c<sup>2</sup> = 689 * 10000<br />

      </p>
      <p>
      Which is significantly shorter than the 3300 ft the patrons would
      have to walk if they didn't have a path to cut directly 
      through the middle of the Visitor/Education Center.  Given this 
      information, you decide that it might be worth the cost to build 
      that bridge or tunnel to cut through. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Again, the problem with this approach is that the Pythagorean Theorem only
      works on triangles with right angles.  If the roads where 
      slanted as in Figure#2, you would not be able to use the Pythagorean Theorem.
      </p>

      <p>
      To overcome this, you could *try* to find a right triangle that has 
      the edge "c" as a hypotenuse; unfortunately, that proves to be a bit difficult
      due to the lack of roads and closings on Pear Street and Cherry Lane. 
      Instead of trying to find a such a right triangle, it might 
      be easier to go ahead and use the Law of Cosines which 
      according to <a href="#src2">[2]</a> says:<br />
      c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> - 2ab cos Θ
      </p>
      <p>
      This doesn't look too much different than the Pythagorean Theorem 
      except for the weird "- 2ab cos Θ" term on the end which we will 
      get to later. 
      </p>
      <p>
      So you already know that the part of Cherry Lane from Hola Camino to 
      Swan Street is 2400 ft (edge b) because it was measured by tape and you also 
      already know that the part of Swan Street from Cherry Lane to 
      Pear Street is 900 ft (edge a) from the same technique.  The only thing you 
      don't know is the angle that Cherry Lane and Swan Street make (Angle Θ) when they 
      interect.  This is easy to get though.
      </p>
      <p>
      To find the Angle Θ, you send a worker out with her super duper
      survey compass to the intersection of Swan Street and Cherry Lane and find out that 
      Cherry lane points 243 degrees going west and that Swan Street points 3 degrees 
      going North.  Since 360 is directly North, your worker finds the angle spread by 
      subracting 243 from 360 and then adding the remaining 3 degrees.  This would 
      give us an equation similar to Θ = (360 - 243) + 3 = 120 degress which is 
      (120 * π) / 180 radians.
      </p>
      <p>
      From the law of cosines, you can then compute the distance as follows:<br />

         This is longer than the longest edge of 2400ft but shorter than the total walking 
         distance of 2400+900=3300ft.  So you can save your patrons some walking distance
         by cutting across the Visitor Center even in the scenario where the roads are angled.
      </p>
      <p>
      So we have seen how the law of cosines works for angles other than 90 degrees or 
      π/2 radians, but 
      does is it really work just like the Pythagorean Theorem?  According to 
         <a href="#src2">[4]</a> it does.  Because if you substitute 
      90 degrees which equals π/2 radians into the formula, you get:<br />
      c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> - 2ab cos (π/2)<br />
      c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> - 2ab (0)<br />
      c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> - (0)<br />
      c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> - (0)<br />
      which is the Pythagorean Theorem.
      </p>
      <p>
      As another extreme example, consider the situation where the angle is 
      180 degrees or π radians.  Then we have a straight line with both edges
      comming right after each other.  This looks like the Figure#3
      </p>

         </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
      Then we have:<br />
      c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> - 2ab cos (π)<br />
      c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> - 2ab (-1)<br />
      c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + 2ab<br />
      c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + 2ab + b<sup>2</sup><br />
      c<sup>2</sup> = (a+b)(a+b)<br />
      c = a+b<br />
      which is intuitive by the picture.  When Θ = 180 or π, then the 
      Law of Cosines shows that the hypotenuse of the "triangle" is simply
      the sum of the lengths of the two sides a and b.

      <p>
      On the other extreme, consider angles less than 90 degrees or π/2.  
      What happens to the triangle as Θ approaches 0.  As Θ gets smaller
      and smaller, the triangle starts looking like a line again, but this
      time instead of segments a and b extending each other they seem to 
      overlap each other.  Leaving c to be the difference between b and a as in 
      Figure 4:

      If we look at the math, we get:<br />
         c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> - 2ab cos (0)<br />
         c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> - 2ab (1)<br />
         c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> - 2ab<br />
         c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> - 2ab + b<sup>2</sup><br />
         c<sup>2</sup> = (b-a)(b-a)<br />
         c<sup></sup> = (b-a)<br />
         Note from FOIL  that both (b-a) and (a-b) are real roots of a<sup>2</sup> - 2ab + b<sup>2</sup> but that
         only the (b-a) example makes sense in this particular case since c should not be negative.

      So you can see that while we didn't <b>prove</b> the law of cosines, we did 
      show (with help from references) that it is an extension of 
      the Pythagorean Theorem and that it works in the special cases where
      Θ = π and Θ = 0.  It is useful to have this law of cosines available 
      in your toolbox for instances when the Pythagorean Theorem won't work. 
      Also, since the Pythagorean Theorem is just a special case of the 
      Law of Cosines, there is no longer any need to remember the 
      Pythagorean Theorem itself (if you could ever forget it).  Personally,
      I will just keep the Law of Cosines in my head moving forward...
