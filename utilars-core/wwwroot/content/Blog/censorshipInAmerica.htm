            I seriously don't feel like writing this.  
            I'm 46 years old and despite the fact that I currently jog 14+ miles every Saturday
            among other exercises, I still have poor resting circulation and get tired easily.
            I have a day job, but in case you don't think YouTube is actually censoring and
            trying to influence people, take a quick look at these pictures...
        </p>
        <p>
            Here I suppose are multiple YouTube posts where I had personally posted
            "mostly" peaceful comments and the said comments section was recently turned off
            by someone or something (I suspect YouTube):<br />
            <img src="/Content/Blog/censor-fig1.png"
            alt="Comments Sections Turned off or Videos Pulled" />
            <br /><br />
            I don't feel like completely verifying right now, but I'm thinking that
            spanned multiple YouTube posts.  Also, it doesn't appear I have any
            way to view the original posts either.  It looks like maybe the
            original videos may have been pulled.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, here is a stupid warning banner I got just for posting a series of
            low-quality election videos in YouTube on how to view the
            New Your Times Pennsylvania JSON Election data.<br />
            <img src="/Content/Blog/warningBanner.png"
            alt="Milder Warning Banner" /><br />
            IIRC, I originally got that warning banner in on multiple posts where I didn't
            actually make overly biased statements regarding my preferred
            2020 presidential candidate who still (as of January 8, 2021) is
            President Donald Trump.  Now, I think the banner is only on
            <b>one</b> of my three posts.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you clicked on the lower part of that banner at one time, 
            you were taken to:
            <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/rumorcontrol">https://www.cisa.gov/rumorcontrol</a>.
            I complained to both YouTube and CISA about this but haven't
            heard back from either.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just today, I woke up this morning to find that I am "shockingly" no
            longer receiving any alerts in Google for any comments I make to
            conservative Republican YouTube posts.  Later this evening, I was trying to
            post a comment on former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee's WebSite
            and the Google reCAPTCHA control kept telling me it couldn't be contacted.
            The control eventually let me through, but it took several tries.
        </p>
        <p>
            To top things off, my WebDeploy stopped working on my WebHosting
            provider last night, so I had to delay this post until today and
            use an alternative (less secure) method to send the changes.  No,
            my WebHost likely isn't associated with Big Tech as they are a
            budget service, but it was frustrating and WebDeploy <b>still</b>
            isn't working for me as far as I know.
        </p>

            I'm concerned that our country is no longer seeking the Lord Jesus Christ.
            I don't want to condemn anyone and I've certainly not always
            behaved the best myself, but I really wish our nation could
            stop and focus on what really matters - The Lord Jesus Christ.
            Yes, I do doubt sometimes but why not try Faith?  Why not give
            the Lord a chance and <b>pray</b> for VP Pence and President Trump
            instead of trying to drag them through the dirt?  Why get all
            violent over this?  Why didn't SCOTUS at least try to hear
            the case of President Trump's legal team?  Also, I believe
            former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee implied on Fox News today
            that maybe some of us can focus on the <b>good</b> things
            President Trump has done for our country.  I know <b>I</b> would rather
            focus on the positive things President Trump has done.
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't have time to sit here and rant about how I feel SCOTUS has failed our
            country or how I was recently "censored" (in my own opinion) during a February 12th, 2020 civil dispute
            with a very special person in my life; however, if you don't think Big Tech is censoring American
            citizens who post legitimate content, you may be mistaken...
        </p>
        <p>
            I am not trying to mislead anyone.  I'm just trying to be honest here.
            Sure, we need to follow mercy and grace and accept the forgiveness of
            the Lord Jesus in our lives, but should people continue to be silent
            while they are being censored?  I'm not endorsing violence or trying
            to sew seeds of destruction, but something seems amiss to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I <b>may</b> come back to this post in the future and elaborate, but
            for now, the few pictures I posted are at least something.
        </p>
        <p>
            Honestly, I don't know who to believe anymore, but these guys seem
            okay to me.  Yes, they are Chinese but I <b>think</b> they are
            <b>American</b> Chinese as opposed to Communist Chinese.<br />

            I can't say for certain if their content is correct or not, but I have
            a pretty good feeling about what they say.  They seem to be
            reasonable people.
        </p>
        <p>
            And no, I do <b>not</b> agree with the Falun Gong religious movement in any
            way, but I feel they should be allowed to peacefully exist.  Despite
            my carnal nature and past sins, I am a follower of Christ and I will
            die a Christian whether that be as a Catholic, Protestant or
            Non-Denominational Christian.  However, one of the beauties of America
            is the ability to chose and practice your own peaceful <b>Faith</b>.  That
            is something President Trump stood up for.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, I'm not getting any kind of kickback or payment from the
            Epoch Times.  I'm just trying to tell you that these people seem
            "real".

            May the Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on us all as our
            nation and world perhaps begin to enter into potentially
            perilous times.<br />
            <br />
            "If we confess our sins, he is Faithful and just and will
            forgive us our sins and will purify us from all unrighteousness." -
            1 John 1:9 NIV<br />
            <br />
            I can only hope that I will continue to turn my life to the Lord
            and surrender to his perfect will in all of this madness.

            <b>DISCLAIMER And Other:</b><br />
            This post is my opinion and does not in any way
            reflect the opinions of any employers I have or may have had.
            This post also does not represent the opinions of any clubs or 
            churches I may attend.  I do <b>NOT</b> represent Epoch Times,
            Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, Potters House,
            Bishop T.D. Jakes, VP Pence or President Trump in any way.  I'm just a fan of these organizations/people.<br />
            <br />
            I would like to reemphasize; however, that if you are looking
            for answers, you might want to checkout Bishop T.D. Jakes out of
            Dallas, TX.  While I personally attend a church locally in
            Arkansas, I do sometimes watch Potter's House sermons and
            I appreciate Bishop Jakes.  One last thing, if you get a chance,
            check out the Left Behind I-III series staring Kirk Cameron.
            I can't comment about the version starring Nicolas Cage, but
            like Bishop Jakes and Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee,
            I feel Kirk Cameron is the <b>real</b> deal!
