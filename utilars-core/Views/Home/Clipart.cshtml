            Here is a picture that I attempted to draw of a Black Hole.  To be
            honest, I'm not sure anyone actually knows what a black hole looks
            like.  I *think* we are all guessing.  Let me know if someone has
            seen "real universe" light effects of a black hole.

            A flower that my daughter Kristen Grace Eary drew.  I scanned it and cut the background out
            to turn it into clipart. You are allowed to use the image in your own collective works; however,
            you must provide attribution at a tasteful place within your presentation.  For example, if
            you are using the image to create a PowerPoint presentation, you may crop out the copyright
            notice on the slide you are using the image on but you must provide a credits section at the
            end of your PowerPoint presentation.  Please use good judgement.
